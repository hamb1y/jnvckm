# Solar Street Lights by 3rd Batch

## 3rd Batch Alumni (1988-1995) | Infrastructure Project | ₹80,000

The 3rd batch alumni addressed the long-standing issue of dark roads inside the school campus during power failures by donating solar street lights worth ₹80,000.

**Problem Solved:**
- Dark roads inside campus during power failure
- Difficulty in dining hall when electricity was out
- General campus lighting issues at night

This initiative serves as a role model for other batches to contribute towards school development.
