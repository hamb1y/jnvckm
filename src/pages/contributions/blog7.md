# Support for Late Kittu Uncle's Family

## Posted by: Harish G P | Community Support Initiative | ₹3,11,550 Raised

In December 2014, the alumni community was saddened by news of Mr. Kittu's severe health condition. He was diagnosed with Motor Neuron disease, with both legs and arms non-functional, and his family faced severe financial challenges.

**Community Response:**
The JNVCKM Alumni Association reached out for financial contributions, and the response was overwhelming.

**Fundraising Results:**
- **Alumni contribution:** ₹2,43,550
- **School staff and students contribution:** ₹68,000
- **Total support provided:** ₹3,11,550

The amount was handed over to Late Kittu uncle's wife and their son in the presence of the Principal and other school staff. Pramod Sir was instrumental in coordinating this fund-raising activity.
