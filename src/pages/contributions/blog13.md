# Batch Representatives Formation

## Posted by: Harish G P | Alumni Association Structure | January 2022

A group of Batch Representatives from each batch has been formed to serve as a bridge between the alumni association and respective batches.

**Role of Batch Representatives:**
- Broadcasting messages to respective JNVCKM batchmates
- Bridge communication between alumni association and batches
- Share information about alumni events/initiatives
- Distribute job alerts and school news

This system ensures effective communication across all alumni batches from 1986-2001.
