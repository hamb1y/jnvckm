    <h1>About JNVCKM Alumni Association</h1>
    <p>
        Established in 1993, the <strong>Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Balehonnur Alumni Association</strong> is a legally registered organization (<em>JNVCKM Alumni Association®</em>) that brings together proud JNVBians in a shared mission of giving back to their alma mater and the wider community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since its inception, the association has fostered ongoing engagement through its core initiative: <strong>"Come in to learn – Go out to serve."</strong> Over the years, alumni have supported the school through mentorship, school welfare projects, and leadership in annual events.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the flagship traditions is the <strong>Annual Alumni Meet</strong>, traditionally held on the first Sunday of December, which brings generations of alumni together for reconnecting and collaboration.
