# Workshop on Creative Writing by Mr. H.S. Raviprakash
## JNV Balehonnur

Mr. H.S. Raviprakash conducted a workshop session on creative writing at Namma JNV on December 17, 2022. Sixty selected students from JNV participated in this session. Raviprakash guided the students through creative writing techniques followed by engaging activities. It was an excellent learning experience for the students.

On behalf of the JNVCKM family (JNVCKM Alumni Association), we thank Raviprakash for spending time with students and introducing them to the magical world of creative writing.

"More than my students, I am deeply inspired and touched. His simplicity, dedication, and commitment are phenomenal." - Mr. Prem Kumar, Principal, JNVCKM
