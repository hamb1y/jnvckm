# Alumni Meet-up at Bengaluru
## BEL Officer's Club

It had been a couple of years since we had an alumni meet at the Vidyalaya campus. On June 19, 2022, we organized a get-together at BEL Officers Club, Vidyaranyapura Road, Bengaluru. The event provided an opportunity to catch up, network, play games, and reconnect with the community.

This was an invitation to all members of the JNVCKM alumni and their families to come together and strengthen the bonds formed during their time at the institution.
