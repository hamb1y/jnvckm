# Career and Guidance Workshop 2006
## JNV Balehonnur

The alumni association organized one of the earliest comprehensive career guidance workshops, establishing a foundation for future IGNITE programs. This workshop demonstrated the alumni association's continuous connection with alumni worldwide and their commitment to involving them in the development of the Vidyalaya.

The association promoted and encouraged alumni to exchange professional knowledge by undertaking and facilitating workshops, meetings, and social gatherings among alumni, students, faculty, and others.
