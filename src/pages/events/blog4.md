# Virtual Alumni Meet 2020
## JNV Balehonnur

We were probably living through one of the most challenging years of this century. COVID-19 had changed our lives significantly. Despite all the hardships we were facing, life had to go on. The first Sunday of December has always been very special to Navodayans, giving us the opportunity to visit JNV and meet all our friends, teachers, staff, and current students. This year's alumni meet was quite different, and here is a snapshot of the virtual alumni meet conducted on December 6, 2020.

An online meeting was hosted on Zoom to facilitate the grand union of staff and alumni. Separate breakout rooms were created for each batch to have informal meetings and relish their good times at Namma JNVCKM.

The event began with the 'Navodaya Song' performed by Mrs. Gayathri Thite (Music Teacher) and supported by music group members. Mr. A. Ravi, PGT Biology, welcomed the gathering. Alumni were informed about important activities and student achievements by Mr. Sunny Joseph (TGT Mathematics).

Santhosh K, Secretary of Alumni Association, addressed the gathering about past activities and future plans. Mr. A.N. Ramachandra, Coordinator (Alumni Affairs & Outreach) at NVS, addressed the alumni and emphasized the importance of alumni contribution.

The Cultural Park contribution by Batch 1994-01 was highlighted by alumnus Anand. The 25th joining anniversary for Batch 1995-02 was celebrated, with Bharath G.M. and Mahesh sharing their memories. A quiz was conducted by Meghavi from Quriosity Knowledge Solutions.

Mr. Benny Joseph, Assistant Commissioner at NVS, joined from Delhi and appreciated the alumni's work. Mrs. Sreekala, In-charge Principal, provided a summary of the Vidyalaya's activities. Vote of thanks was delivered by Sampath Kumar, President of Alumni Association.
